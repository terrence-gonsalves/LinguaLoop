# LinguaLoop

**LinguaLoop** is an open-source, goal-driven language learning tracker.
It helps you stay motivated and organized by letting you set language goals, track your daily activities, visualize your progress, and connect with other learners.
Built with React Native, Expo, and Supabase, LinguaLoop is designed for both casual learners and serious polyglots.
